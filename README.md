Wildlife Chatbot

This project is a multimodal chatbot that processes both images and text prompts to provide information about wildlife. It combines computer vision and natural language processing to identify animals and respond to user questions.

Project Overview

The notebook allows users to upload an image along with a text prompt. The system analyzes both inputs and generates a response, such as identifying the animal or providing factual information.

Requirements

The project requires Python, Jupyter Notebook, and common libraries such as Pillow, Requests, Gradio, and API integrations like Groq or OpenAI. The exact dependencies can be installed before running the notebook.

Usage

Clone the repository, open the Jupyter Notebook, and run the cells. Upload an image and provide a prompt when requested. The chatbot will then generate a contextual response.

API Key

The project uses external AI models that require an API key. Ensure that the key is set as an environment variable before running the notebook.

Example

A user can upload a photo of an elephant and ask, “What is this animal and where does it live?” The chatbot will identify it as an elephant and provide relevant information about its habitat and characteristics.

Future Improvements

Planned improvements include broader image format support, deployment with an interactive web interface, and integration with a structured wildlife knowledge base.
